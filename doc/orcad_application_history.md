# OrCAD Application History

[OrCAD File Format Compatibility](https://techsupport.ema-eda.com/support/solutions/articles/48001157688-capture-file-format-compatibility)

SDT stands for Schematic Design Tools

SDT File Format (`*.sch` for schematics and `*.pcb` for layouts) ([Example Design](http://ecgnosis.corlan.net/electrocardiognosis-3183.tgz))
Schematic Design [RE](https://pcengines.ch/orcadff.htm)

The tools 'Layout' and 'Layout Plus' are the predecessor products to Allegro that generated `*.MAX` files [1]. They were dropped after OrCAD v16.0 [2].

I guess there where some `*.MAX` layout files in between?

New File Format (`*.DSN` for schematics, `*.brd` for layouts)
